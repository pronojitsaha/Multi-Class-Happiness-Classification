# Multi-Class-Happiness-Classification
Classifying the happiness of the residents of a city based on a survey

The government of the Smarticon city (name withheld) commissioned a survey and collected various attributes of residents along with their happiness level (Very Happy, Pretty Happy and Not Happy). Objective of this survey was to help government to classify residents based on their happiness level. The Government then wants to come up with more specific and relevant policies for respective group of residence based on their level of happiness.


##Problem Description:
With the survey, Smarticon government has access to more than 13000 responses. But scaling up the survey to every citizen is very cost prohibitive in nature. Hence, it was required to build a model to predict the happiness levels of the citizens and then build policies on those classes.
